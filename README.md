# Analyzing Job Market Data in Tableau Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing job market data using Tableau. The primary objective is to uncover insights about in-demand skills for data-related roles such as data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers. The dashboard showcases trends in job postings, salary expectations based on experience, and key performance indicators (KPIs) like the number of applicants and job postings.

## Key Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preparation for exploration.
- Analyze job postings trends across different roles in the data industry.
- Identify the most in-demand skills and compare them with supply by experience levels.
- Build an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize the insights for stakeholders.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Excel**: For dataset management and preparation.
- **Calculated Fields**: To enhance the analysis and extract additional insights.
- **Tableau Dashboards**: For presenting the final results in a user-friendly format.

## Trends from Analysis

- **Demand for Job Titles**: The dashboard categorizes job roles into three primary segments: Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst. Data Scientist roles seem to have a higher prominence based on job postings and applicants, as seen in the Venn diagram visualization.
  
- **Experience Levels**: The "Experience Analysis" box plot shows that roles requiring more experience (especially mid-senior and director levels) generally demand more years of experience, while internships and entry-level positions have minimal experience requirements.
  
- **Salary Expectations**: There is a clear upward trend in salary with experience across roles, with the dashboard indicating a significant jump for **Data Science Managers**, where salaries peak at $218,500 for around 9-10 years of experience. On the other hand, **Data Engineers** show steady salary increases, while **Data Analysts** generally have lower salary progression, peaking around $61,000.
  
- **Postings Over Time**: The timeline visualization shows job postings have fluctuated significantly from November 2016 through November 2021. The number of postings shows a gradual rise over time, with periodic peaksâ€”likely influenced by external economic or industry-specific factors.

## Key Visualizations

- **KPI Overview**: The KPIs on the dashboard highlight 1,298 job postings and 27,335 applicants across various data-related roles, showing a competitive market.
  
- **Salary vs. Experience**: The line chart represents salary growth over years of experience across different roles. Data Science Managers have the steepest salary progression, while Data Analysts have more modest growth.
  
- **Experience Level Analysis**: The box plot displays how job roles distribute across different experience levels, showing that director and executive roles demand significantly more experience.
  
- **Job Postings Over Time**: The area graph shows the count of job postings across different experience levels over time, providing insights into hiring trends.

## Insights

- **Data Science and Data Engineering Roles**: These roles offer the highest salaries, particularly for senior positions, while Data Analysts show lower salary ceilings, which aligns with their typical scope of work.
  
- **Significant Growth in Senior Roles**: Positions requiring over 9 years of experience, especially for Data Science Managers, see a substantial increase in salary. This highlights the value companies place on senior-level professionals in data fields.
  
- **Steady Demand**: The job posting trends indicate a steady increase in demand for data professionals over the years, likely driven by the increasing reliance on data-driven decision-making in businesses.

## Files in Repository

The repository contains the following files related to the project:

- **`job_postings.xlsx`**: The dataset used for the analysis, containing job postings, titles, years of experience, and other key information.
  
- **`HarshaanthKumar_ThiyagarajaKumar_JobMarketData.twbx`**: The Tableau workbook file with the complete analysis and dashboard.
  
- **`Dashboard.jpg`**: A screenshot of the final dashboard created in Tableau, summarizing key insights from the analysis.
  
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file explaining the project, key findings, and details about the repository contents.

## Conclusion
This case study helped me refine my Tableau skills by applying real-world data to build visualizations and dashboards. The insights from this analysis provide valuable information for understanding job market trends, in-demand skills, and the relationship between salary and experience.
